# Snake!
Each linked list node represents a segment of the snake, therefore we must be able to create a linked list, create nodes, push them to the back, and update node positions.

## Button Controls:
**LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN: ** Move the snake across the screen, turn it to the side, and change directions.

## Win/Lose Condition:
The objective of the game is to move the snake without accidentally hitting the walls/edges of the screen or hitting the snake itself. If you do, the snake will turn red, die and the game will end. :((((


## Have fun testing your quick reflexes and keyboard skills by playing this game!! How long can you slither before you die??
